# Word-Parser
The idea behind this project is to find out what is important to job recruiters. We can do this by pulling text from a job listing and looking at which words are seen at a higher frequency. This project is fed data from a CSV file and sorts them alphabetically while counting the instances they appear. It then sorts them in decreasing value. Finally, it asks the user, one by one, if the word is important enough to them to record the value of times it is scene. Because this is a long process, I used a random number generator to choose for the user. Finally it inputs the newly found data into a new CVS file.
